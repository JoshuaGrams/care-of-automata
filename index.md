Inspired by [Furkle](https://twitter.com/furkle_)'s talk at [NarraScope](http://narrascope.org/) 2019.

This outlines one way to get started in programming while reducing some of the usual early problems. It's opinionated. It's a deliberately over-simplified view of things. There are loopholes in and caveats to most of the things I'm going to say; there are contexts where they're just plain wrong, and possibly even dangerous. Take it with a grain of salt, YMMV, etc.

It uses JavaScript [because reasons](why-javascript). But I strongly believe that [all programming languages are similar](similar-languages), so I'm trying to explain things in a way that will serve you well regardless of what languages you go on to use.

So:

* Computer programming is [learned primarily through &ldquo;failure&rdquo;](learn-through-failure). That does **not** mean you are bad at it: it's the fastest way to get better.

* [Running JavaScript code](running-javascript).

* [Designing Programs](designing-programs).

* [Variables](variables).
