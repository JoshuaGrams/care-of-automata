Names
-----

JavaScript names can contain `$`, `_`, letters and numbers, and may not start with a number. They may not contain spaces or any other punctuation.

These days, &ldquo;letters and numbers&rdquo; means Unicode letter and number characters and combining/accent marks, so feel free to write names in your local language. If you're making a library for other people to use, and you want it to gain traction outside your language community, you'll probably need to make the public names in English. But otherwise, do whatever you want.
